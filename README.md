"""We need one excel file(kerdesek.xlsx), then we will add questions from B1 to x1 columns (B1,C1 etc...).
Our answers will be right below them.The correct answer will always be the second row(B2, C2 etc...). 
We will shuffle them later, so it won't be in the same position when we print them to the user. 
In this code we can write four answers down.
So it will look like something like this:
Question1  Question2  Question3
Correct1    correct      same
answer2    ....       ....
answer3    ....       ....
answer4    answer4     ....
"""
